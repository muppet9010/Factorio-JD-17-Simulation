# Factorio-JD_17_Simulation
Mod aims to include all science, recipe and game changes that are sensible to simulate in 0.16 that have been announced for 0.17. Also all technologies are hidden until you have researched all of the ingredients, as per comment in FFF.
A number of exact costs are not known so an estimated cost has been applied for an approximate feel.

Choice Modifications
--------------
There are a number of chnages in this mod that are not mentioned in any FFF, but have been either implied or suggestedby developers or suggested by the community. These changes are listed below for reference:

 - assemblying machines all have an ingredient limit of 6
 - assemblying machine 2 requires steel in recipe
 - assemblying machine 2 crafts at speed 1 with proportional enegy increase, but same total pollution

 - player base mining speed equal to iron axe and graphics show using a mining tool, not hands.
 - upgrade for player minning speed to equivalent to steel axe in 0.16
 - all 0.16 minning tool recipes and technoligy removed.

 - chemical science pack production time reduced to similar with military, as suggested as possible by devs.
 - space science is a very expensive research as it is the gateway to infinite sciences

 - tier 2 personal equipment, armor and laser defense changed from processing units to low density structures.
 - power armor and fusion reactor require later military researchs
 - personal laser defense equipment does 50% damage and uses 33% power

 - tank bullet damage reduced to same as player, but still shoots +50% sped over player. Tank cannon does +20% damage to 0.16
 - car bullet damage stays the same as player, but still shoots +50% speed over player. Now has a stock rocket launcher weapon attached.


Notes
-----------
At present the new researches don't have any specific placement order in the tech tree and old technologoes haven't been re-ordered. So they may be a little oddly placed.
